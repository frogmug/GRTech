#This will hold the homework assginment from GRTech.
#
#   Using the IaC tool of your choice, create a free-tier VM in either AWS or Azure that meets the following objectives:
#The instance should use a 1 GB attached block storage volume and contain a valid partition table with one partition. The partition should contain a valid file system.
#The filesystem residing on the attached volume should be mounted automatically upon reboot of the instance.
#The instance should serve web pages via an appropriate service such as Apache, Nginx or IIS. This service should start automatically upon boot.
#The instance should serve a web page index.html containing the text “Hello GR World”. This file should reside on the filesystem within the attached volume and be served from the Document Root directory.
#The instance should effectively use security groups to restrict traffic to HTTP and either RDP or SSH.
#The instance should be associated with a static IP address.
